# 👋 Hi, I’m @santacata
## I'm an IT "DAM" student

- 👀 I’m interested in tech in global, mobiles, PC, everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the drivers license, but I got superior studies on photography and editing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any custom ROM for Samsung A52, if I can help being a beta tester.
- 📫 You can reach me on my email ruben_olle@hotmail.es
- I would be so happy if I can help, I'm sometimes too curious.

>This should help you
